 📘JWT Forgery Exploit Report –  OSWAP JUICE SHOP

 📘 Project Overview

This project was completed as part of my cybersecurity internship at Future Interns. The goal was to test a sample web application for common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and authentication flaws. I used industry-standard penetration testing tools to identify issues and documented findings in a formal security report.

✅ Summary of Findings

- SQL injection vulnerability found in login form query parameters  
- Reflected XSS triggered via search input and URL manipulation  
- Insecure authentication detected through token exposure and session flaws  
- Suggested mitigation includes input validation, secure session handling, and proper error messaging
