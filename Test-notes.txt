Test Notes â€“ Web Application Security Testing
---------------------------------------------

Project Context:
This testing activity was part of my cybersecurity internship focused on identifying web application vulnerabilities such as SQL injection (SQLi), cross-site scripting (XSS), and authentication flaws.

Approach & Methodology:
- Performed manual and automated scans using Burp Suite and OWASP ZAP.
- Verified SQL injection risk through query manipulation and response behavior.
- Tested XSS by injecting scripts in form inputs and URL parameters.
- Examined session management using browser DevTools and token analysis via jwt.io.

Observations:
- SQL injection detected on login form with successful data retrieval simulation.
- Reflected XSS activated using `<script>` payload in search and contact forms.
- Authentication bypass observed via exposed session token and lack of validation.
- All findings were captured with screenshots for documentation purposes.

Challenges Faced:
- Rate-limited responses during repeated payload testing
- Handling false positives in ZAP automated scans
- Understanding token encoding techniques for auth flaws

Outcome:
Successfully documented vulnerabilities and proposed mitigation strategies including input sanitization, proper error handling, and secure session validation.
